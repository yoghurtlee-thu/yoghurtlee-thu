**你好,我是李垚,来自清华大学某班.**

**Hi, I'm Yoghurt Lee from Tsinghua University.**

我是一个计算机小白,希望能通过自己的学习成为一名计算机大佬(有点不自量力,哈哈).

I'm a computer noob, but I hope to become an expert through my own study (a bit unimaginative, haha).

我目前还不熟悉Github,但是我会尝试着学习使用这个平台,并且试着在上面发布一些东西.

Despite the fact that I'm not familiar with Github at the moment, I'll try to learn to use the platform and post something on it.

如果我发布的东西对你有所帮助,希望你能给我点亮星星.如果有什么问题,欢迎你留言与我交流.

If the code I posted is helpful to you, I sincerely hope you can give me a star. Leaving a message to communicate with me is always welcomed if you have any questions.

> I'm hopeful every day
